## Git & GitHub

> But what's in it for you? <br>
Let's say, you want to write lecture notes for your class. Each lecture consists of a vast number of equations, tables, graphs, diagrams, simulations, code and obviously, formatted text. You want to update these notes as you go along the course. You also want to allow the reader to access only a certain portion of the notes (eg. Lec1,2,...) if he wants to. <br>
This is exactly what we will tackle in today's talk.

- __What's Git?__ <br>
    Git is a distributed, version-control-system (VCS) for tracking changes in source code. <br>
    It was created by Linus Torvalds (= creator of _Linux_) to manage the [Linux Kernel source code](https://github.com/torvalds/linux). <br>
Just to give you an idea of how much modern systems rely on Git, we'll look at the number of commits (or changes to source code) made to this project. <br>
[Git: Source Code](https://github.com/git/) <br>
This the source code for Git itself! <br>

- __What's Github?__ <br>
    GitHub allows you to host your content (probably source code) on the internet, allowing you to manage it using Git. <br>
So, Git is the tool that allows you to manage several versions of a software, and GitHub gives you a website where you can post/manage your work online. <br>

Hi `$z = x + y$`.

`$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$`

`$$\begin{vmatrix}a & b\\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc$$`
